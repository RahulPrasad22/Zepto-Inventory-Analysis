# Business Insights Delivered :
- **Data Quality Improvements**: Identified and removed invalid records (e.g., products with MRP = 0) and standardized pricing from paise to rupees to ensure accurate financial calculations.

- **Stock & Product Analysis**: Segregated products based on stock status and discovered high‐MRP items (>₹300) that were out of stock—highlighting lost sales opportunities.

- **Revenue Estimation** : Calculated estimated revenue per category using discounted selling price and available quantity to identify top revenue-generating categories.

- **Pricing & Discount Strategy**:
a) Listed top 10 best-value products with the highest discount percentage.
b) Highlighted products with MRP > ₹500 but discount <10%, exposing potential candidates for targeted discounting.
c) Identified top 5 categories with the highest average discount percentage, helping refine promotional strategies.

- **Value Optimization**: Computed price per gram for products ≥100g to rank items by best value and assist in competitive pricing.

- **Inventory Weight Distribution**: Calculated total inventory weight per category and grouped products into Low, Medium, and Bulk weight categories to optimize storage and logistics.
